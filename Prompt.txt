📋 PROBLEM STATEMENT SUMMARY
Build a Rental Management System that enables businesses to rent products online while managing:
✅ Quotations
✅ Rental Orders
✅ Inventory & Reservations
✅ Invoicing & Payments
✅ Pickup & Return Workflows
✅ Dashboards & Reports
Complete ERP Rental Lifecycle
Quotation → Order → Reservation → Pickup → Return → Invoice → Reporting

Django ORM (no raw SQL unless absolutely necessary)
SQLite (development database)

Frontend

Django Templates (server-side rendering)
HTML5 (semantic markup)
CSS3 (custom only—NO frameworks)
Vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery/libraries)

❌ DO NOT USE

React / Vue / Angular
Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS
Mobile applications
REST API initially (focus on MVP)

RolePermissions & AccessCustomerBrowse products, create quotations, place orders, track rentals, download invoicesVendorManage products, confirm orders, process pickups/returns, view earningsAdminFull system access, settings configuration, analytics, user management
Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) using Django's permission system.

🎨 UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
Design Reference
Mockup Link: https://link.excalidraw.com/l/65VNwvy7c4X/3tAPpflFLrG
Follow this mockup EXACTLY.

Dashboard-driven navigation (cards with key metrics)
Responsive tables for orders/invoices/products

🏗️ ARCHITECTURE FLOW (FOLLOW THIS EXACT ORDER)
Phase-by-Phase Development
YOU MUST proceed in this sequence. DO NOT skip steps.
PhaseTasks1Project setup & app folder structure2Database models (models.py ONLY)3Admin panel configuration4Authentication & role-based access5URL routing (urls.py)6Business logic views (views.py)7Reservation & availability calculation logic8Templates (HTML rendering)9Static files (CSS/JS)10Reports & dashboard generation11Security, validation & error handling12Hackathon demo preparation & polish

💼 WORKING METHODOLOGY (MANDATORY)
For EVERY Development Step:

📁 Identify the file being created/edited
🧠 Explain the business reason (why does this exist in a real rental company?)
💻 Provide clean, commented Django code
🔗 Explain the connection to the next step
⏸️ STOP and wait for my confirmation before proceeding

Code Quality Standards

PEP 8 compliant Python code
Meaningful variable names (no x, temp, data)
Docstrings for all classes and complex functions
Inline comments explaining business logic
No hardcoded values (use settings/constants)


🏆 HACKATHON WINNING MINDSET
Think Like an Odoo Developer

Build modular, reusable components
Implement proper ERP state machines (Draft → Confirmed → Done)
Use smart defaults (auto-calculate fields, pre-fill forms)
Add audit trails (who changed what, when)

Prioritization Strategy

Business correctness over fancy UI
Working workflows over feature breadth
Demo-friendly flows (easy to show value)
Data integrity over performance optimization

Demo Preparation

Ensure every feature maps to a real business problem solved
Create realistic demo data (not "Test Product 1, 2, 3")
Make workflows visually obvious (status badges, progress bars)
Prepare a 2-minute pitch: "This system prevents overbooking by..."

The Ultimate Test

"Could a real equipment rental company use this system tomorrow and run their business with it?"

If the answer is YES, you're on track to win.

====================================================
WORKING STYLE (MANDATORY)
====================================================
For EVERY step:
1) Tell me which file we are editing
2) Explain why this step exists in real business
3) Provide clean, commented Django code
4) Explain how it connects to next step
5) STOP and wait for my confirmation

Also there would brevo smtp integration and appyflow gstin api integration in the app.

Also the pdf for the problem statement and the objective and working of this app is provided with all the specifications. In case of confusions or lack of information you must refer to the pdf rather than the prompt.

You must remember that for the whole flow of the app you must refer to the wireframe provided in this link https://link.excalidraw.com/l/65VNwvy7c4X/3tAPpflFLrG. This link contains the wireframe which has all the information of what happens when a person clicks a specific button, the whole flow of the app is in the link itself.

Also in the code, write comments on the side of models, forms or any other thing like that, which provides the clear idea of its use case and to whom it is useful.
