Budget Accou nting System – Shiv Fu rniture  
  
Shiv F urniture requires a centralized Bu dget Acco unting System  to record purchases, sales, 
and paym ents while enabling co st-cen ter–w ise budget monitoring. The system  should 
support financial discipline by ensuring that operational activities are aligned with approved 
budgets and provide clear visibility into financial perform ance.  
 
Due to the lack of st ructured linkage between t ransactions, cost centers, and budgets,  Shiv 
Furniture faces challenges in: 
● Tracking budget utilization against actual incom e and expenses 
● Monitoring spending across dif ferent  business activities 
● Maintaining consistent m aster dat a usage 
● Obtaining tim ely and reliable budget  perform ance insights 
A unified accounting and budgeting system  is required to address these challenges.

 6. Success Criteria
7. Why This Hackathon Problem is Important

Analytical Acco unts (Co st Cen ters) 
Unlike the Chart of Accounts (which tracks what the m oney is for , e.g., "Electricity"), A nalytical 
Accounts track where or on what activity t he m oney is being spent. 
● Example: You pay f or "M arketing" (G eneral A ccount), but link it to "F urniture Expo 2026" 
(Analytical Account) to see if that specific event w as profitable. 
Budget vs. Actu als 
The core of your proje ct. It is the process of com paring your planned financial targets (B udget ) 
against t he real-world money m oving in and out (Actuals). 
● Actu als are pulled from   "Posted" journal entries. 
● Varian ce is the dif ference bet ween the t wo. 
Auto-Analytical M odels 
A tool to autom ate analytical applicability . Instead of an accountant m anually select ing a cost 
center for every single invoice line, t he system  uses rules (like "any product in category 'W ood' 
goes to the 'P roduction' analytical account") to link transactions autom atically . 
 
Payment Status & Reco nciliatio n 
The logic that connects a Payment record to an Invoice or V endor B ill. 
● Fully Paid: Payment amount equals the Invoice total. 
● Partially P aid: A paym ent was m ade, but a balance rem ains. 
● Reco nciliatio n: The "handshake" between a bank  entry and an invoice that m arks it as 
"Paid" in t he system .
